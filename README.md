# Reusable Building Blocks

This is a template repository for Reusable Building Blocks (RBB - TODO: insert reference here).

> RBBs are submodels that describe processes relevant for a broad range of ABMs in a certain application domain, for example plant competition in vegetation models or reinforcement learning in a behavioral model.

 It should be customized with an open source license, documentation, scripts, and the following attributes:

## Name

The name of this RBB and references to the literature or other RBBS

## Purpose

What is this RBB for?

## Narrative Documentation

- Entity
- Context
- Process: the very RBB
- Parameters

## Pseudocode / visual examples 

Pseudocode and/or visual diagrams or flow charts describing the submodel of the RBB.

## Source Code

Qualified references to the precise versions of the RBB code - these should be persistent identifiers like a DOI or permanent URL that ideally follows the FAIR4RS Principles

## Example implementation

A reference implementation that uses the RBB and serves as an example of how it can be used and incorporated into a larger model.

## Use history

Qualified references to the use history of this RBB, a curated list that grows over time.

## User's guide | manual | tutorial

For more complex RBBs, a detailed user's guide or manual and a tutorial walk through can be very helpful to onboard new users.
